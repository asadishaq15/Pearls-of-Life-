        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <p>The idea of the PEARLS OF MY LYFE (POML) website came about when a staff member’s cousin passed away unexpectedly at the early age of 50. The staff member always thought she would learn how to put together a funeral from her- now deceased- cousin because in their family when someone passed away, everyone gathered with old obituaries, pictures and other documents to put in the obituary and program for the funeral. Well, at that time, most of her family was deceased. Her cousin unexpectedly passed, and she was devastated having no older relatives to consult with about the process.</p>
          
          <p>In addition, her cousin’s adult children looked to her for guidance on how to proceed. All she could do was pray for help and try to recall the times when, as a young girl, she sat at someone’s kitchen table with family, listening to conversations and trying to recall the process. This was heartbreaking and emotionally draining. The funeral parlors could only be of little assistance. The actual dates, names, times, sibling information, etc. must come from the family. She completed the task hoping all the information was correct. She helped the adult children get through their season of bereavement and then said to herself…There must be a better way to handle these kinds of situations. How can I make this process easier?… After 12 months of intense development and testing PEARLS OF MY LYFE was created to make that processes seamless and it is now available to everyone. Sometimes we don’t have the words when we are in front of loved ones. Some relationships are estranged or it’s hard to communicate; but you still care and have life lessons, moments and valuable instructions to give them. Now, you can take your time, think about what this life and your family and friends have meant to you; and leave it all in your PEARLS OF MY LIFE account.</p>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <p>The creator of PEARLS OF MY LYFE witnessed many funerals where information pertaining to the deceased was incorrectly given or incorrectly printed on the funeral program. Have you seen this? For generations people have relied on family obituaries to obtain a deceased member’s date of birth, correct last name, sibling information, etc. These personal data points are essential to families who wish to maintain or research historic ancestral content. Information you place in your POML account help families maintain accurate obituary records for your funeral program.</p>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <p>If you have lived a life, you have something great to leave your family. PEARLS OF MY LYFE has re-imagined how you can leave a legacy for the family. A legacy is not just about money and assets. With POML you can capture cherished and meaningful moments you’ve experienced throughout your life. There may be experiences you wish to share and leave for estranged family members. No one can tell a story better than the one who lived it. Individuals are best positioned to explain their own feelings; lessons learned from experiences; Ex: times spent in the old neighborhood with grandparents and friends; (or) the point at which they begin to feel like responsible adults;(or) how you managed tough times (or) family members who instilled value in you; (or) other life experiences and insights. These are all “pearls” that each one of us possess and they should not be tossed away or forgotten upon our graduation into eternity.</p>
          
          <p>Have you ever longed to hear the voice or face of a loved one who has graduated into eternity? With PEARLS OF MY LYFE, you can see a family member talking to you about the things they cherished the most in their life, although they have passed away; then you can leave the same type of legacy for your loved ones.</p>
          <p>Think about that… When your loved one lived, they thought enough of you to want to leave a personal memory, wisdom or light to a path for you to have as a guide or comfort- SMILE. With that, your life can be brighter. Isn’t that how it is supposed to be?</p>
          <p>At times, articulating our thoughts can be challenging when engaging with loved ones. Nevertheless, individuals often possess the desire to impart their life lessons and provide valuable guidance. Take your time and consider your experiences in life and the impact of relationships with family and friends then record it all in your personal PEARLS OF MY LYFE account. Now one except your “key holders” will be able to access this information. You can also select what you want to have included for your funeral program.</p>
          <p>PEARLS OF MY LYFE has re-imagined the process and created a great way for you to leave the best of you. Use this space to reminisce on key moments and discuss personal standards, morals and ideals to create an invaluable legacy.
            Breathe easily and smile, your life is not in vain. It has purpose -SMILE AGAIN</p>
