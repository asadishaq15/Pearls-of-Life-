            <h2>Create Your Legacy</h2>
            <p>PEARLS OF MY LIFE are the things that I have cherished the most. There are many experiences that bring us joy and we wish to share with family. Things like the old neighborhood, spending time with grandparents, old friends, old hangout places, the way things used to be or older family members who instilled value in you.

            </p>
            
            <p>These are all pearls that each one of us have experienced and know carry with us. They should not be tossed away or forgotten upon our graduation into eternity.</p>
            
            <p>What if PEARLS OF MY LIFE existed in the past? You could click a place in this website and see an old family member talking to you about the things they cherished the most and want to leave the memory behind for you to have (smile); or what if they left behind some wisdom that could keep you out of trouble and on a good path in life. That is how it is supposed to be, family passing down traditions, wisdom, knowledge and many other things.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we don’t have the words when we are in front of loved ones. Some relationships are estranged and it’s hard to communicate. You still care about them and have value to give them. Now, you can take your time, think about what this life and your loved ones have meant to you; and leave it all in your PEARLS OF MY LIFE account.</p>
            <p>If you don’t know where to start and need help. Visit the “moments to share” section to spark ideas.</p>
